# 📊 HR Analytics Case Study | Tableau and PostgreSQL (June 2024 - June 2025)

## 📘 Project Overview

Used advanced SQL to query 3,000+ employee records and identify attrition drivers across departments and job roles. Built an interactive Tableau dashboard highlighting turnover rates, performance scores, and tenure distributions.

## 📂 Dataset Information

The project uses the following CSV files:

- `Employee.csv`: Contains employee information (e.g., age, gender, department, job role, marital status, hire date, attrition).
- `EducationLevel.csv`: Maps numerical education levels to descriptive labels (e.g., 1 = High School).
- `PerformanceRating.csv`: Maps performance codes to rating labels (e.g., 3 = Exceeds Expectations).

These datasets were preprocessed and joined using SQL before visualization in Tableau.

## 🎯 Project Objectives

- Understand employee distribution across departments, age groups, and education levels.
- Identify trends in employee attrition by department, job role, and tenure.
- Visualize performance ratings and satisfaction metrics.
- Build HR KPI dashboards showing total employees, attrition rate, and status breakdown.

## 🛠️ Tools Used

- **Tableau** – for data visualization and dashboard design.
- **PostgreSQL** – for joining and cleaning CSV files.
- **Microsoft Excel** – to prepare and inspect CSVs before loading into Tableau.

## 📊 Key Dashboards

The project includes one main dashboard in Tableau:

### HR Dashboard

Visualizes employee trends using multiple sheets, including:

- **Attrition Analysis**: by department, education level, hire date, tenure, and travel.
- **Demographics**: age groups, gender, marital status, education level.
- **Hiring Trends**: hiring over time and attrition comparison.
- **KPIs**: total employees, current employees, past employees, and attrition rate.

Each chart and card is interactive and filterable for deep HR insight.

## 📌 Insights Summary

- Departments such as Sales and R&D show higher attrition.
- Employees with frequent travel and lower education levels are more likely to leave.
- Performance ratings are mostly consistent across gender and education level.
- Most employees are aged 30–45 and are married, with a bachelor's degree.
